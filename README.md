## MAET Game Development Kit

### MAET Game Development Kit is a made-from-scratch JavaScript toolkit I am creating to make my own game development easier.
It aspires to one day be a full-fledged game engine, but for now it is an under-documented library that attempts to decouple commonly re-used game logic from game-specific logic.

You can take this code and do as you would like with it to the full extent that the MIT license attached to it permits.
However, part of the reason I am making this project is to learn and advance as an indie game developer, so it is my wish to try to figure out as much as I can on my own in this particular fork.
I am certainly not against collaborating or offering feedback in other forks of MAET-GDK, though!
